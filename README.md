## Canadian Open Parkinson Network - Quebec Parkinson Network Database

The Canadian Open Parkinson Network (C-OPN) is a Canada-wide research network that collects demographic, epidemiological and clinical data, as well as blood samples processed to isolate DNA, serum and PBMCs for iPCS generation, from people living with Parkinson’s disease (PD) or a related disorder. C-OPN is actively recruiting participants from the following centres/networks:

  * [Quebec Parkinson Network](https://rpq-qpn.ca/) (McGill University, University of Montreal, University of Laval)
  * Parkinson Research Consortium in Ottawa (University of Ottawa)
  * Movement Disorders Centre at the Toronto Western Hospital (University of Toronto)
  * [Calgary Parkinson Research Initiative](https://brainandmentalhealthclinics.ca/programs/calgary-parkinson-research/) (University of Calgary)
  * Movement Disorders Program (University of Alberta)
  * Pacific Parkinson’s Research Centre (University of British Columbia)

A primary goal of C-OPN is to support cutting-edge, multi-disciplinary and multi-site PD-related research studies across Canada and possibly beyond.

#### Key Metrics:

* No. of participants enrolled in C-OPN: **974**
* No. of participants currently in LORIS platform: **681**
* No. of biospecimens available: **422** DNA, **268** serum, **262** PBMC samples

In addition to the above-mentioned resources, C-OPN also houses a Participant Registry, to which researchers can promote their research studies as a means to facilitate subject recruitment.

* No. of participants in Registry: **962**

C-OPN members can gain access to all the resources described above, including the C-OPN LORIS platform, and more. To become a C-OPN member or learn more, visit: [https://copn-rpco.ca/members/](https://copn-rpco.ca/members/)

The C-OPN LORIS dataset accompanies one other database:
